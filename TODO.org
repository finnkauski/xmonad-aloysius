* Done [15/15]
  - [X] tidy up gaps with polybar
  - [X] pimped polybar with current layout descriptor (pprint)
  - [X] make fullscreen logout
  - [X] swapped out rofi for X.U.Dmenu
  - [X] implemented dynamic projects
  - [X] M-M1 now uses flexible manipulate (discrete - window is 9 blocks)
  - [X] added scratchpads
  - [X] sort out xautolock to prevent locking on screen with video playing
  - [X] xset oddity where any window activity sees the polybar icon turn back on, this was
  - [X] X.A.WindowBringer has been added for window switching by name
  - [X] X.L.IfMax added so that layouts with single window end up maximised
  - [X] Incorporate goodness from https://github.com/altercation/dotfiles-tilingwm/blob/master/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
  - [X] dmenu changed to overlap polybar completely, spacing issue removed
  - [X] Fix xset bug (still locks even with `xset -dpms`)
  - [X] remove that monstrous gif and replace with smaller images


* TESTED/REJECTED/WONTFIX [5/5]
  - [X] X.U.Themes - see if nord and dracula can be added -- going to just keep my themes in my format, if anybody else ever wants to use it then maybe revisit but just for me there's little to no point
  - [X] XMonad.Hooks.DynamicBars  -- sticking with one bar
  - [X] rejected betterlockscreen (https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen), delay for lock is liveable
  - [X] look into using glances to generate JSON for outputting somehow - lost interest
  - [X] screen locking: being in a script is actually ok, need to tidy the script
