#+TITLE: XMonad-Aloysius

* GENERAL [0/8]
  - [ ] keybindings are currently all over the place
    + get toggle float all and sink all
    + helper scripts to throw in ~/.scripts
    + see how wmctl can help me out
  - [ ] use urgencyhook to either change the colour of the workspace in polybar
    or do a notify-send (alternatives?)
  - [ ] M-S-` for an alternative scratchpad with custom command?
  - [ ] Develop additional colour schemes
  - [ ] work through https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.15/docs/XMonad-Doc-Extending.html
  - [ ] make screen locking better, currently in a script outside xmonad and the
    sound control is really clumsy
  - [ ] consider window decorations for float workspace
  - [ ] clickable layout selector


* NON XMONAD SPECIFIC [0/2]
- [ ] lightdm switch to greeter should release the pulseaudio sink
- [ ] general research into pulseaudio configuration
- [ ] update git prompt to show ahead/behind status


* ACTIVE [0/1]
  - [ ] remove that monstrous gif and replace with smaller images


* DEFER [0/2]
  - [ ] https://github.com/pjones/xmonadrc has some dynamic project helper functions
  - [ ] Design a sound scheme


* Done [14/14]
  - [X] tidy up gaps with polybar
  - [X] pimped polybar with current layout descriptor (pprint)
  - [X] make fullscreen logout
  - [X] swapped out rofi for X.U.Dmenu
  - [X] implemented dynamic projects
  - [X] M-M1 now uses flexible manipulate (discrete - window is 9 blocks)
  - [X] added scratchpads
  - [X] sort out xautolock to prevent locking on screen with video playing
  - [X] xset oddity where any window activity sees the polybar icon turn back on, this was
  - [X] X.A.WindowBringer has been added for window switching by name
  - [X] X.L.IfMax added so that layouts with single window end up maximised
  - [X] Incorporate goodness from https://github.com/altercation/dotfiles-tilingwm/blob/master/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
  - [X] dmenu changed to overlap polybar completely, spacing issue removed
  - [X] Fix xset bug (still locks even with `xset -dpms`)


* TESTED/REJECTED/WONTFIX [4/4]
  - [X] X.U.Themes - see if nord and dracula can be added -- going to just keep my themes in my format, if anybody else ever wants to use it then maybe revisit but just for me there's little to no point
  - [X] XMonad.Hooks.DynamicBars  -- sticking with one bar
  - [X] rejected betterlockscreen (https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen), delay for lock is liveable
  - [X] look into using glances to generate JSON for outputting somehow - lost interest
