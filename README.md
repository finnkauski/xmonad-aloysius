## Dependencies

Here are all of the things which this setup needs to work. If you install all of
them you should be able to have the intended experience out of the box. If you
are content editing the configuration files (which you will have to do
eventually) then all of the following should be easily replaceable.

If you notice any missing dependencies please raise an issue so that this table
can be updated.

contains an overlay for nixpkgs with additional software.


## Default applications

This setup is pretty opinionated. I have some explicit applications named in
`./lib/App/Alias.hs` which you may wish to change to your own preferences.

| Function | Choice    |
| ---      | ---       |
| Terminal | `urxvt`   |
| Browser  | `firefox` |
| Mail     | `geary`   |
| Music    | `spotify` |
| IDE      | `emacs`   |

If you prefer other apps then edit them in this file.
