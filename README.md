A [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) themed XMonad configuration.


## Details

This XMonad configuration is my attempt at making it feel more like a desktop
environment featuring a lot more mod-cons than you typically find in a tiling
WM. You will also need my polybar configuration, available in the wiki, as well
as all of the supporting scripts available
[here](https://gitlab.com/karetsu/scripts).

My personal setup looks like:

- **OS**:       nixOS
- **WM**:       XMonad
- **Terminal**: kitty
- **Launcher**: dmenu2
- **Editor**:   [doom emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)
- **Browser**:  firefox

See below for how to change these for your preferred options. If the build
instructions do not seem to work on your preference of OS then please raise an
issue. As the build is managed in a nix-shell then it should "just work".

## Dependencies

Here are all of the things which this setup needs to work. If you install all of
them you should be able to have the intended experience out of the box. If you
are content editing the configuration files (which you will have to do
eventually) then all of the following should be easily replaceable.

If you notice any missing dependencies please raise an issue so that this table
can be updated.

For the polybar configuration files please see
[here](https://github.com/karetsu/nix-overlays). This is managed by home-manager and
contains an overlay for nixpkgs with additional software. You also need my
custom scripts directory available [here](https://github.com/karetsu/scripts).


## Default applications

This setup is pretty opinionated. I have some explicit applications named in
`./lib/App/Alias.hs` which you may wish to change to your own preferences.

| Function | Choice    |
| ---      | ---       |
| Terminal | `kitty`   |
| Browser  | `firefox` |
| Mail     | `geary`   |
| Music    | `spotify` |
| IDE      | `emacs`   |

If you prefer other apps then edit them in this file.


# Installation instructions

The development plans for this eventually involve moving to a `~/.build` script
which does everything for you. This is not yet implemented so for now you need
to do the following:

``` sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/karetsu/xmonad-aloysius ~/.xmonad
cd ~/.xmonad
./build
```
